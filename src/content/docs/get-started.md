# FBCS architecture

**for building service oriented scalable next/react application**
Feature Based Component and Service architecture

\*This architecture is still in evolution to support implementations of full backend apis. Currently it is focused on building and consuming gateways alone.

## folder structure goals

This folder structure is developed based on separation of responsibilities
Each folder shares a single responsibility. The application will be located in the `src/` directory so that we can separate the testing related directory from the project structure.
